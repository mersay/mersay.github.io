# About me

I'm currently based in Toronto, as a freelance **Full Stack Software Engineer**, been building applications since 2015.

---

I am a hands-on problem solver who loves combining math and computer science to build tools that solve real-world problems — often ones I encounter myself. From developing predictive models for horse racing to creating a custom keyboard app for personalized typing, I enjoy turning ideas into working systems. Beyond tech, I’ve also run brick-and-mortar businesses, from selling merchandise to coaching kids in math, which has strengthened my problem-solving, communication, and entrepreneurial mindset.
